    "### Submitting the Completed Assignment\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is intended to be used like a digital worksheet or notebook. By this, I mean that you should complete this laboratory assigment directly in this Jupyter notebook.

    "### A Common Source of Confusion for Students Starting out with Jupyter\n",
    "Once you have installed Anaconda (instructions: https://youtu.be/Y-9Hlrq1kt8), you are able to create and open Juypter notebooks (tutorial: https://youtu.be/ffECekZH4Yk). One thing that sometimes confuses students is that Jupyter notebooks are opened in a browser, giving the impression that the notebook is online, but it is not! When you download the files for this lesson, it included a file called LennardJonesFluidLab.ipynb. Any changes you make to this notebook are saved in the file LennardJonesFluidLab.ipynb. It only appears to be online because your browser is used to view and edit Jupyter notebooks."

    "## Background\n",
    "Lennard-Jones fluid simulations are some of the oldest molecular simulations in the history of computational chemistry and physics. I believe this paper from 1957 is the first ever computer simulation of a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid:\n",
    "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1743822. Much has changed since then (e.g. your phone could run circles around the room-sized computers they used), but the LJ fluid remains a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of fluids that is still widely used today! \n",
    "### Motivation for the LJ Fluid Model\n",
    "The forces driving the motions of fluids are the result of incredibly complex interactions governmed by quantum mechanical effects. Although it is possible to model these quantum effects directly and calculate the forces from them (often called _ab initio_ simulations - meaning *from the beginning*), a much less computationally expensive approach is to fit mathematical functions that return approximately the same forces that solving the more difficult quantum equations would yield. Consider a noble gas, like argon. We know that the interaction energy between two argon atoms that are very far apart (say 500 $\\mathring A$ apart) should be pretty much constant if we make a small change to that large distance. At the opposite extreme, pushing two argon atoms together very close should make the energy grow very large very quickly. We also know that, when within a few $\\mathring A$ or so of each other, argon atoms are attracted to each other via Van der Waals forces. There must also be some sort of \"happy medium\" equilibrium bond length where the atoms are neither being push apart or pulled together, a bit like a spring that is at its equilibrium length. The Lennard-Jones potential energy function is pretty much the simplest mathematical function that will nicely accomplish all of these conditions. The Lennard-Jones potential energy function is defined in **Eq. 1** below:\n",
    "### $$ U(r_{ij}) = 4\\epsilon \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r_{ij}}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r_{ij}}\\right)^{6}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U(r_{ij})$ is the potential energy due to molecules $i$ and $j$ interacting at a distance $r_{ij}$, and $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$ are parameters that can be tuned to fit the behavior of different types of interacting particles. For a more in-depth look at the Lennard-Jones potential, there is an excellent article by Luca Zammataro that I recommend you check out (https://towardsdatascience.com/the-lennard-jones-potential-35b2bae9446c). \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Microcanonical Ensemble\n",
    "Just like a group of musicians is called an ensemble, the name given to a group of particles, in the standard nomenclature of statistical mechanics, is an *ensemble* (also the reason I named the Python object that stores a collection of molecules an Ensemble in my Python simulation code). Specifically, the type of ensemble we'll be working with is what is known as a *microcanonical ensemble*. The hallmark of the microcanonical ensemble is that the number of particles, volume, and total energy are constant, thus why this ensemble is often said to be under NVE conditions. NVE is great for simulations, and seeing the potential and kinetic energies perfectly balance is a thing of beauty; however, it makes them very difficult to compare with experimental measurements. Imagine trying to mainting constant total energy in the lab, it's essentially impossible for most chemical systems! Constant temperature, on the other hand, is easy to do experimentally. If you have ever run an organic reaction in a flask that is either in an ice bath or a hot oil bath, you have done this yourself. So although we recognize that the NVE ensemble makes comparisons to experiment difficult, the goal here is to give you a gentle introduction to computational chemistry and molecular simulations, and for that, the NVE ensemble is perfect. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Important Note on the Microcanonical Ensemble and Temperature:\n",
    "An important thing to be aware of is that one's choice of ensemble makes it impossible to hold some pairs of observables constant! Imagine you had a sealed rigid container filled with gas (constant volume and constant number of molecules) and in contact with an oil bath at constant temperature (NVT conditions). For this NVT system, the choice to keep volume constant actually makes it impossible to maintain constant pressure inside the container! One way to think about this is that the energy in the system at a given temperature can be distributed into some combination of kinetic energy (e.g. velocity due to translational movements) and potential energy (e.g. compressing a bond), but temperature only depends on kinetic energy. In the case of our microcanonical ensemble, since the total energy is constant, any increase in potential energy means a decrease in kinetic energy, and a decrease in kinetic energy means the temperature dropped. Thus, by holding the total energy constant in the NVE ensemble, we have made it impossible to maintain a constant temperature! So although we initiate our microcanonical simulations using an initial temperature, we cannot expect the system to remain at this temperature throughout the simulation. "

    "One can think of 3-dimensional LJ particles as being somewhat squishy spheres, and 2-dimensional LJ particles as somewhat squishy circles or disks.
